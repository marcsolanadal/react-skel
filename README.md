Custom React Skel
=================

Currently the skel is working with the following stack:

- Webpack
- React
- Styled components
- Flow
- Redux

Current features:

- Hot Module Replacement
- Browser sync on save

Missing features:

- Webpack production build
- ESLint
- Redux Chrome devtools
- Testing
- Handle paths

Project structure:

- Each functionality is separated in individual folders containing the needed files. 
- The interface to other modules is the index.js file. In there we can expose selectors.
